I am an Assistant Professor of Statistics at Macalester College in the Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science. My research interests lie in the application of statistics to study biology (particularly with high-throughput techonolgies), medicine, epidemiology, and public health. I am also interested in how humans interact with data in ways that impact analysis, understanding, and scientific communication.
