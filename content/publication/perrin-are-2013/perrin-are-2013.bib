 abstract = {In a widely publicized and controversial article, Regnerus (2012a) seeks to evaluate what he calls the “'no-differences' paradigm” with respect to outcomes for children of same-sex parents. We consider the scientific claims in Regnerus (2012a) in light of extant evidence and flaws in the article's evidence and analytical strategy. We find that the evidence presented does not support rejecting the “no-differences” claim, and therefore the study does not constitute evidence for disadvantages suffered by children of same-sex couples. The state of scientific knowledge on same-sex parenting remains as it was prior to the publication of Regnerus (2012a).},
