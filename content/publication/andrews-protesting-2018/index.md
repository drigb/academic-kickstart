abstract = "This article charts the emergence of protest in the wake of the 2016 presidential election describing trends in protest activity from the first to second Women's Marches. We document characteristics including the magnitude, issue diversity, geographic range, tactical repertoire, and persistence of street protest, and we highlight key similarities and differences between this wave of protest and other recent episodes in the U.S. We conclude by pointing to important empirical and theoretical questions that movement scholars should address through analysis of this case."
